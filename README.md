A simulation system for a logistics company with multiple warehouses and delivery trucks. The system meets the below specified requirements to simulate the movement of vehicles between warehouses and delivery points.
- Delivery vehicles need to be capable of moving from one place to another (e.g. from warehouses to delivery) locations. Attributes such as vehicle ID and current location should also be included.
- Develop a code that simulates the movements of the vehicles in real-time.
- Develop a method that evaluates different factors, including traffic, drop-off points, and distance, in order to determine the best possible paths.
- Generate reports to display the effectiveness of the routes using print statements.
